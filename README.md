# F5 Engage XC WAAP

This repository is a ***temporary*** document for Asean F5 Engage's Test-Drive/Hands-On on F5 Distributed Cloud (XC).

F5 Engage conducted two hands-on classes:
- [ ] Class 1: [F5 Distributed Cloud - Introduction to Deployment Models and Services](https://clouddocs.f5.com/training/community/f5xc/html/class1/class1.html) ([Lab 1](https://clouddocs.f5.com/training/community/f5xc/html/class1/lab1.html), [Lab 2](https://clouddocs.f5.com/training/community/f5xc/html/class1/lab2.html) and [Lab 3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/training/community/f5xc/html/class1/lab3.html) only)
- [ ] Class 2: [F5 Distributed Cloud - WAF/WAAP Deeper Dive](https://clouddocs.f5.com/training/community/f5xc/html/class2/class2.html) ([Lab 1](https://clouddocs.f5.com/training/community/f5xc/html/class2/lab1.html), [Lab 2](https://clouddocs.f5.com/training/community/f5xc/html/class2/lab2.html) and [Lab 3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/training/community/f5xc/html/class2/lab3.html) only)

However, each class should start with assumption of a new/clean XC NameSpace.
While for F5 Engage this may not be the case, this document's purpose is bridging the gap when student has finished Class 1, and about to start Class 2, while their NameSpace still has objects created for Class 1.

Students can choose one of the options and click the link below to continue:
- [ ] [Delete Existing Objects and Start Over for Class 2](/Delete)
- [ ] [Re-Use Existing Objects for Class 2](/ReUse). ReUsing the existing objects assumes student has finished successfully Class 1 - Lab 1, 2 and 3.
